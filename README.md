# Android audio decoder sample

This app uses the OpenSL api to decode a few audio files, measuring the time taken for conversion.

OpenSLDecoder.cpp/hpp and OpenSLEngine.cpp/hpp are portable classes wrapping the OpenSL api.
DecodeTest.cpp and TestActivity.java show how such wrapper can be used.

The app does nothing with the decoded data (no operation on the audio samples is performed, and no disk writing either).

Code references:
[Google sample](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/wilhelm/+/master/tests/examples/slesTestDecodeToBuffQueue.cpp) ,

Here are some test results: you will notice that the decoding times skyrocket on Android 7.0+ devices.
